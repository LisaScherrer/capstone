## 1 Introduction

For my capstone project I wanted to make a data analysis of the journal articles of the University of Lucerne.

## 2 Retrieving Crossref Data

To access the data I made a Get request, however it is only possible to request 1000 articles per request made. Additionally I was not able to access more than 10000 articles in total. That is why I made 10 requests to get all the data I needed which I joined together as "df_journal".

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 3 Joining the Requests Together

## 4 Analysis and Visualisation
