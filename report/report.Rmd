## 1 Introduction

The of this project are journal articles that are by authors affiliated with the University of Lucerne. In order to answer my research question on the connection between different meta data and the amount of citations of these journal articles and ultimately to answer what makes a successful paper.

In the following chapter *2 Hypothesis* the assumptions about this purpose I retrieved the meta data of the specified journal articles through a REST API which is described in more detail in chapter *3 Retrieving Data.* Next the raw data was transformed and displayed through a list of the top 10 most published articles as well as number of visualisations, including a stacked plot and a scatter plot, connecting the meta data variables and the amount of citations. These two steps are detailed in chapter *4 Visualisation and Analysis*. Finally, in chapter *5 Conclusion* the findings and limitations of this research project are summarised.

## 2 Hypotheses

The parameter for a successful article and dependent variable is the amount of references. The university is a young institution not having published studies with "cult status", the first Hypothesis (H1) is that there are very few highly cited articles. However, these articles can gain acclaim through discussing current topics, therefore recent publications are more popular (H2). The language of the article also plays a role due to the increasing importance of English, that is why English publications are cited more often than other papers (H3) and the share of English publications has increased (H4). Lastly, articles that are of an interdisciplinary nature are relevant to more research fields and yield better results and regardless of the few study programms offered the publishers are diverse (H5).

## 3 Retrieving Data

### 3.1 GET Request

To access data related to journal articles the REST API by Crossref was used. To establish the connection a GET request was made. In the case of this API it is only possible to request 1000 journal articles per request made.

In order to automate the process of making several requests a loop was created. However, it was not possible to access more than 10000 articles in total. This was only discovered later when looking at the contents of the data and found the last request information to be empty. To avoid the for loop running until the total of 276 000 journal article data was retrieved an if condition was implemented. When the infomation contains less then 10 000 characters the loop stops and the following empty information is not requested.

### 3.2 Saving and Transforming

Additionally, the data should be saved immediately after every request. In the case of this data set it was not possible to use *write.csv()* since the information was not two dimensional. The author column for instance contained further lists detailing the different authors and further the institutions they were affiliated with. That is why the data was saved with *save()* to create a file in .Rda format.

Since the data had to be requested multiple times these seperate responses were joined into one file. For this purpose a Loop was created to merge these data frames together as df_journal. The data was saved in a .Rda file format again because of the complexity of the data.

## 4 Analysis and Visualisation

### 4.1 Reference Count

*Figure 1* and *Figure 2* represent the distribution of the reference counts of the articles, while all articles with reference count NA were removed. It is apparent that there is a strong tendency for articles to have very few citations as previously hypothesised (H1).

![Figure 1](images/hist_ref.png)

As visible in *Figure 2* the papers quoted 0-5 exceed 5000 and represent more than half of the sample.

### 4.2 Timeline

To analyse a possible corralation between the year the articles were written and their citation count these two variables were plotted against each other in *Figure 3.* In the scatter plot there does not seem to be a visible connection between the two variables, therefore not fulfilling the requirements for further analysis with a regression model and disproving H2.

### 4.3 Language

![](images/ref_lang.png)

In *Figure 4* we can see that the share of German publications has decreased. While all publications from 2002 of the sample were in German a significant amount of publications were written in English in the last decade. Despite the political importance of French the amount of French articles are significantly lower than the English publications, supporting H4.

### 4.4 Publisher

According to H5 there the articles should be published in a wide array of research platforms. In order to test this hypothesis a bar chart was created showcasing the 10 most common publishers. In *Figure 5* the variety of publishers focusing on a host of different fields including *Trans Tech Publications, Ltd.,* the *American Society for Microbiology* and *Horgefe Publishing Group*. This is in line with H4.

### 4.5 Top 10

In order to round off the analysis the most cited papers are compared the previous findings to see if they are in line with the observed trends.

```{r}
load("data/df_journal.Rda")

top_papers <- df_journal %>%
  arrange(desc(is.referenced.by.count)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 10) %>%
  select(title, is.referenced.by.count, author)  # Adjust these column names if needed

top_papers$author <- sapply(top_papers$author, function(x) paste(x, collapse = ", "))

print(top_papers)
```
