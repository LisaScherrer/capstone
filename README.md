Welcome to my Capstone Project Repository

Here you will find the scripts and data used in my Capstone Project for the master seminar *Data Mining for Political and Social Sciences in R*. The project is about the analysis of the data, regarding the meta data, specifically citations, of journal articles by authors that are affiliated with the University of Lucerne. This data was retrieved from Crossref API.

My repository is structured in the following four folders:

*data*

-   crossref.Rda: containing the original data from the requests to the API

-   df_journal.Rda: containing the data joined together into one data frame

*scripts*

-   01-import.R

-   02-join.R

-   03-analysis.R

*visualisations*

-   

*report*

-   report.html

-   report.R

Have fun exploring my project!

Best wishes
