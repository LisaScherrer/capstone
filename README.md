Welcome to my Capstone Project Repository

Here you will find the scripts and data used in my Capstone Project for the master seminar *Data Mining for Political and Social Sciences in R*. The project is about the analysis regarding the meta data of journal articles by authors that are affiliated with the University of Lucerne. This data was retrieved from Crossref API.

My repository is structured in the following four folders:

*data*

-   crossref.Rda: original data from the requests to the API

-   df_journal.Rda: joined data

*scripts*

-   01-import.R: data request

-   02-join.R: data joining

-   03-analysis.R: data visualisation

*visualisations*

-   hist_ref.png
-   hist_ref250.png
-   scatter_ref_year.png
-   ref_lang.png
-   ref_langu_time.png
-   hist_publisher.png

*report*

-   report.html

-   report.R

Let me know if there are any problems with reproducing the code or if any questions arise.

Have fun exploring my project!

Best wishes

Lisa
